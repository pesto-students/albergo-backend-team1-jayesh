# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
